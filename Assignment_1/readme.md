Files:

1. assignment_1_1.cpp		-	Implements the first part of the assignment
				-	Use C++ compiler to compile
				-	Takes in 3 inputs:
						- Dimension of the matrix (n)
						- Start point of the path (s)
						- End point of the path   (t)
				- 	Generates its own graph

2. assignment_1_2.cpp		-	Implements the second part of the assignment
				-	Use C++ compiler to compile
				-	Takes in 3 inputs:
						- Dimension of the matrix (n)
						- Start point of the path (s)
						- End point of the path   (t)
				-	Generates its own graph
		

3. assignment_verify.ccp 	-	Implements code for verification of the output
				-	Use C++ compiler to compile
				-	Takes in 3 inputs:
						- Dimension of the matrix
						- Start point of the path
						- End point of the path
				-	Uses the graph generated by either of the files

Note: Expected that n > s, n > t & s != t
