Report on NVIDIA CUDA-X

NVIDIA CUDA-X is built upon NVIDIA CUDA.
It is a collection of tools and libraries that deliver way more performace than their CPU counter-parts. It is used in AI, HPC, ML and alot of other domains.
They provide highly optimised implementation since libraries run on every kind of machine from IoT devices to Super-Computers.
